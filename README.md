# Hex Address Dissection and Combination

## Overview

This project demonstrates a computer science task using low-level C programming, bitwise operations, and system knowledge to dissect two hex addresses and combine them into a new hex address. The goal is to illustrate how bitwise manipulation and understanding of memory layout can be applied to solve practical problems.

## Features

- **Hex Address Dissection**: Learn how to break down hex addresses into their constituent bytes using bitwise operations.
- **Address Combination**: Combine specific bytes from two hex addresses to form a new hex address.
- **Low-Level C Programming**: Understand the use of C programming for system-level tasks.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Practical applications of bitwise AND, OR, and NOT operations.
