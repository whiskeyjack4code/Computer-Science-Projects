# Low Level Systems Programming with C and Assembly

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to Computer Science projects related to low-level systems programming with C and Assembly. It encompasses both theory and practical examples of creating systems applications, while exploring how a computer system works under the hood.

## Topics Covered

- **Endianness**: Understanding byte order and its implications in systems programming.
- **OS Abstractions**: Exploring files (I/O), virtual memory (main memory and disk), and other operating system abstractions.
- **Data Representation**: How information is stored and represented, including integers, floats, and strings.
- **Memory Management**: Creating tools like `malloc` and `calloc` for dynamic memory allocation.
- **Socket Programming**: Implementing a web server using socket programming to understand network communication.
- **And More**: Various other topics and tools relevant to systems programming.
